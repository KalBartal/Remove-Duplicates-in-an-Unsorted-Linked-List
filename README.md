# Removing Duplicates from Linked List in Python

[ ![Removing Duplicates from Linked List in Python](./image.png)](https://youtu.be/LZ4uSiVrRDc)

This repository contains Python code for removing duplicates from an unsorted linked list. The algorithm has a run time complexity of O(n), meaning it can detect any duplicate elements quickly and efficiently remove them.

I have a video walkthrough of this challenge available on my [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/LZ4uSiVrRDc) and [my blog](https://kalbartal.net/remove-duplicates-in-an-unsorted-linked-list-in-python/).

It includes a Node class that stores values and their respective pointers, as well as a sample input to demonstrate the code in action. You can find more information about the problem and how to solve it in the accompanying video tutorial.

This project is perfect for anyone who is looking to increase their understanding of linked list and coding problems in Python, as well as deepen their knowledge of concepts such as run time complexity and algorithm efficiency.
